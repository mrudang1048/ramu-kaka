story 
A hound dog found a bone and held it tightly in his mouth .
He growled and scowled at anyone who attertimpted to take it away.
Off into the woods he went to bury his prize.
When he came to a stream, he trotted over the footbridge and happentued to glance into the water. 
He saw his own reflection. Thinking it was another dog with a bigger bone, he growled and scowled at it.
The reflection growled and scowled back.
"I'll get THAT bone too," thought the daddy dog, and he snapped his sharp tooth at the image in the wuiter.
Alas, his own big bone fell with a splash, out of sight, the moment he opened his mouth to bite!
